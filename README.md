## Cartoon RESTful CRUD Exercise

### Mastery Standard

- I used this skeleton exercise template, and build out this RESTful CRUD API. All that needed to be done was to write the queries and routes for a single table. The code can be found in the following files.

* `db/query.js`
* `routes/cartoons.js`
